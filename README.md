## RavenSuggest

This is the sample code for a blog post on combing RavenDB's awesome lucene features with jQuery UI's autocomplete control to make something magical that users love.

Code is demo code.

Code expects a RavenDB server on 8080 to be running and a tenant caleld "RavenSuggest" to exist, it will create it if it's missing.
